<strong>Task Form Localization Test</strong>

<form class="form-horizontal">

	<p>
		Here you can see a localized text: 
		{{ 'REQUIRED_FIELD' | translate }}.
	
		The translation is taken from the tasklist language properties file, which you can easily extend yourself.
		See <a href="https://github.com/camunda/camunda-tasklist-translations/">https://github.com/camunda/camunda-tasklist-translations/</a>.	
	</p>
	
	<p>By the way, you can also use Angular to e.g. calculate something: {{ 1+2 }}.</p>

</form>
